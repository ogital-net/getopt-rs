# getopt-rs

A Rust wrapper for the Unix getopt function for parsing command line arguments.

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
getopt-rs = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

This library provides a safe Rust interface to the Unix `getopt` function for parsing command-line options. It supports both simple flags and options with values.

### Basic Usage

```rust
use getopt_rs::Getopt;

fn main() {
    // assuming
    // program -a -b value -c file1 file2
    let args: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();
    let getopt = Getopt::new(&args, "ab:c", true);

    // Iterate over the options
    for opt in &getopt {
        match opt.val() {
            'a' => println!("Flag -a was set"),
            'b' => println!("Option -b had value: {}", opt.arg().unwrap()),
            'c' => println!("Flag -c was set"),
            '?' => println!("Unknown option: -{}", opt.erropt().unwrap()),
            _ => unreachable!()
        }
    }

    // Process remaining arguments
    println!("Remaining arguments: {:?}", getopt.remaining());
}
```

### Option String Format

The option string follows Unix getopt conventions:
- Must be single byte characters
- Single letters represent flags (e.g. `"ab"` allows `-a` and `-b` flags)
- Letters followed by `:` represent options that take values (e.g. `"a:b:"` means `-a value -b value`)
- Is passed directly to the system's libc getopt() function permitting any platform specifc extensions


### Error Handling

The library handles two types of errors:
- Unknown options: Returns an `Opt` with `val() == '?'` and `erropt()` containing the invalid option
- Missing arguments:
  - If optstring starts with ':': Returns an `Opt` with `val() == ':'` and `erropt()` containing the option
  - Otherwise: Returns an `Opt` with `val() == '?'` and `erropt()` containing the option

### Option Comparison

Options can be directly compared with characters:

```rust
use getopt_rs::Getopt;

let args: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();
let getopt = Getopt::new(&args, "a", true);
if let Some(opt) = getopt.into_iter().next() {
    assert!(opt == 'a');
}
```
